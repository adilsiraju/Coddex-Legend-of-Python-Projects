# FizzBuzz Game

The classic FizzBuzz programming challenge implementation.

## Description

FizzBuzz is a popular programming exercise that prints numbers from 1 to 100, but with special rules:
- For multiples of 3: print "Fizz"
- For multiples of 5: print "Buzz"
- For multiples of both 3 and 5: print "FizzBuzz"
- For all other numbers: print the number itself

## How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```

## Game Rules

1. Numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 → "FizzBuzz"
2. Numbers divisible by 3 → "Fizz"
3. Numbers divisible by 5 → "Buzz"
4. All other numbers → Print the number

## Example Output

```

```

## Learning Concepts

- For loops and range()
- Modulo operator (%)
- Conditional statements (if/elif/else)
- Logical operators (and)
- Multiple condition checking
- Classic programming patterns

## Why FizzBuzz?

FizzBuzz is often used in programming interviews and coding exercises because it tests:
- Basic programming logic
- Understanding of conditionals
- Proper use of loops
- Problem-solving skills

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
