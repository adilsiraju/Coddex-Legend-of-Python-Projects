# Detention Assignment

A simple program that demonstrates loops by printing a repetitive detention message.

## Description

This program simulates a classic detention assignment by printing "I will not use Snapchat in class" 100 times, mimicking the traditional punishment of writing lines.

## How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```

## Output

The program prints the message "I will not use Snapchat in class" exactly 100 times.
