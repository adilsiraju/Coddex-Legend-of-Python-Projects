# Inventory - Built-in Functions

A LEGO parts inventory system demonstrating Python's built-in functions.

## Description

This program manages a LEGO parts inventory by using Python's built-in `min()` and `max()` functions to find the smallest and largest part numbers in the collection.

## How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```

## Features

- LEGO parts inventory with part numbers
- Automatic minimum value detection
- Automatic maximum value detection
- Clean output display

## LEGO Parts Included

The inventory contains the following part numbers:
- 8980, 7323, 5343, 92700, 92232, 1203, 7319, 8903, 2328, 1279, 679, 589

## Output

The program displays:
- The smallest part number in the inventory
- The largest part number in the inventory
