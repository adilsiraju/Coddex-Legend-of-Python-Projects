# Pythagorean Theorem Calculator

A mathematical calculator that computes the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.

## Description

This program calculates the length of the hypotenuse (side c) of a right triangle when given the lengths of the other two sides (a and b) using the famous Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c²

## How to Use

1. Run the program: `python main.py`
2. Enter the length of side a when prompted
3. Enter the length of side b when prompted
4. The program will calculate and display the length of side c (hypotenuse)

## Mathematical Formula

**c = √(a² + b²)**

Where:
- a and b are the lengths of the two shorter sides (legs)
- c is the length of the hypotenuse (longest side)

## Features

- Interactive input for triangle dimensions
- Precise mathematical calculations
- Results displayed to 2 decimal places
- Clear user prompts and output

## Example

```
Enter length of side a: 3
Enter length of side b: 4
Length of side c is: 5.00
```

This demonstrates the famous 3-4-5 right triangle.
