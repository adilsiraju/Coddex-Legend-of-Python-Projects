# Mars Orbiter - Distance Converter

A distance conversion utility that converts kilometers to miles, themed around Mars orbital calculations.

## Description

This program converts distances from kilometers to miles using the standard conversion factor. It's themed around space exploration and Mars orbital distance calculations.

## How to Use

1. Run the program: `python main.py`
2. Enter the distance in kilometers when prompted
3. The program will display the equivalent distance in miles

## Conversion Formula

**Miles = Kilometers รท 1.609**

## Features

- Space exploration theme
- Accurate distance conversion
- Function-based architecture
- Clean user interface

## Example

```
Enter distance in km: 687
Distance in miles: 426.95
```

*Note: The average distance from Earth to Mars is about 687 million km*

## Learning Concepts

- Function definition and calling
- Mathematical operations
- Unit conversion logic
- User input handling
- Modular programming

## How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```

## Space Facts

- Earth to Mars distance varies from 54.6 million km to 401 million km
- Mars orbital circumference: ~1.429 billion km
- Mars diameter: ~6,779 km

## Requirements
