# Bank PIN Entry System

A simple banking PIN verification system that simulates ATM security.

## Description

This program simulates a bank's PIN entry system, requiring users to enter the correct PIN (1234) to gain access. It demonstrates security validation and loop-based retry logic.

## How to Use

1. Run the program: `python main.py`
2. Enter your PIN when prompted
3. If incorrect, you'll be asked to try again
4. Keep trying until you enter the correct PIN (1234)
5. Access is granted when the correct PIN is entered

## Features

- Secure PIN validation
- Retry mechanism for incorrect attempts
- Persistent loop until correct PIN is entered
- Bank-themed interface

## Security Note

**Default PIN: 1234**

*In a real application, PINs would be encrypted and stored securely*

## Learning Concepts

- While loops
- Conditional statements
- User input validation
- Security basics
- Loop control flow
- Input handling

## How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```

## Requirements
